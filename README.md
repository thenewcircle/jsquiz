# NewCircle JavaScript proficiency quiz

The intent of this interactive, HTML+AngularJS quiz is to allow AngularJS
JavaScript students to assess their abilities, as a precursor to taking
the course.

## Building

First, install [Node.js][]. Next, install [Gulp][]:

    $ npm install -g gulp

Then, within this source directory, install the local packages necessary
to run Gulp:

    $ npm install

Finally, just run `gulp`:

    $ gulp

Everything will be built and copied into the `dist` subdirectory.

[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/
[Gulp]: http://gulpjs.com/

## Deploying

Deploy all the files in the `dist` directory, and tell the students to
point their browsers at the `index.html` file.
